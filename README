This contains two python files.
Both read an Excel file and write a CSV file for each sheet.
(The main work is done by Python pandas module, so you will need that installed).

xl2csv_quick.py does that and nothing else. ("python xl2csv_quick.py excelfile")

xl2csv.py has a few options and extra features:

xl2csv.py reads an excel file, and for every sheet named SHEET:
 - writes a csv file SHEET.csv
 - optionally writes a TAB-separated file SHEET.tsv
   - as another option, TSV fields are truncated to 7 chars so they line up vertically.

To see options, type:

$ python xl2csv -h
