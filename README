xl2csv.py

Reads an excel file, and for every sheet named SHEET:
 - writes a csv file SHEET.csv
 - optionally writes a TAB-separated file SHEET.tsv
   - as another option, TSV fields are truncated to 7 chars so they line up vertically.

The main work is done by Python pandas module, so you will need that installed.

To see options, type:

$ python xl2csv -h
